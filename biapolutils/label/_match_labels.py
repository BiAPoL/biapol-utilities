    ----------
    masks : 3D-array, int
        Stack of stacks to be stitched with axis order ZYX

        Method to be used for stitching the masks. The default is 'iou' with a stitch threshold of 0.25.

    ----------
    imageA : nd-array
        Image that should serve as a reference for label-matching
